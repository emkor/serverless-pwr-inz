                <h3>Domain and purpose</h3>
                <p>The app retrieves information helpful for potential travellers from public APIs of 3rd parties like
                    Weather API, Uber API, Instagram API and SkyScanner API.</p>
                <p>App is focused on western-European countries, but adding more cities would not be a problem.</p>
                <p>Application was built to research possibilities of Serverless architecture approach and confront it
                    with classic distributed approach.</p>

                <h3>Frameworks and technologies used</h3>
                <p>Front-end application is written using angularjs framework with bootstrap applied and based on
                    node.js platform while running on npm's built-in http-server.</p>
                <p>Backend API is written in Python 2.7 with usage of Celery framework (with RabbitMQ as a message
                    broker and MySQL as result storage) for local executor and is exposed by CherryPy web server. AWS
                    Lambda executor uses Serverless Framework for deploying remote functions.</p>
                <p>For deployment of each of the component (excluding AWS Lambda executor), Docker container is
                    used. Managing deployment is possible thanks to Docker Compose technology.</p>

                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>Application was created as a part of Engineering Thesis at Wroclaw University of Technology (Faculty
                    of Management and Computer Science) by Mateusz Korzeniowski.</p>
                <p>Thesis subject is: Web based application supporting planning of tourist travel, built using
                    Serverless architectural pattern</p>
